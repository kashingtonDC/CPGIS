# Course Overview

## Welcome!

This is a comprehensive online course for learning **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** fundamentals. Whether you're a student, professional, or simply curious about GIS, this course will teach you the essential skills needed to work with spatial data.

## What is This Course?

This is a **self-paced, open-source** learning resource that covers:

- Core GIS concepts and theory
- Hands-on software skills (QGIS and ArcGIS Pro)
- Real-world applications and examples
- Practical lab exercises
- Project-based learning

## Course Structure

The course is organized into **15 topics**, each covering a major area of GIS:

### Foundation Topics (Weeks 1-4)
- What is GIS and why it matters
- Spatial data models (vector and raster)
- Coordinate systems and projections
- Data creation and editing

### Intermediate Topics (Weeks 5-10)
- Database management and joins
- Vector geoprocessing operations
- Field data collection (GPS)
- Raster data and digital elevation models
- Raster analysis techniques
- Remote sensing fundamentals

### Advanced Topics (Weeks 11-15)
- Interpolation and zonal statistics
- Workflow design and automation
- Modern web mapping
- Advanced applications
- Synthesis and integration

## Learning Approach

### Active Learning

This course emphasizes **learning by doing**. You won't just read about GIS - you'll actively work with spatial data, solve problems, and create maps.

### Software Agnostic

While labs provide instructions for both **QGIS** (free) and **ArcGIS Pro** (commercial), the concepts you learn apply to any GIS software. Understanding the "why" is more important than memorizing button clicks.

### Progressive Complexity

Topics build on each other progressively. Complete them in order for the best learning experience.

## Time Commitment

- **Per Topic**: 2-3 hours (lecture + reading)
- **Per Lab**: 2-4 hours (hands-on practice)
- **Total Course**: ~60-80 hours

## Who Is This For?

This course is designed for:

- **Undergraduate students** in geography, environmental science, planning, natural resources
- **Professionals** wanting to add GIS skills
- **Researchers** who need to work with spatial data
- **Self-learners** interested in mapping and geospatial analysis

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy (file management, internet navigation)
- Access to a computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Willingness to problem-solve and learn independently
- No prior GIS experience required!

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

✅ Understand fundamental GIS concepts and terminology
<br>✅ Work confidently with vector and raster spatial data
<br>✅ Perform spatial analysis to answer real-world questions
<br>✅ Create professional-quality maps and visualizations
<br>✅ Design and execute complete GIS workflows
<br>✅ Understand remote sensing and satellite imagery
<br>✅ Apply GIS to problems in your field of interest

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion, you will have:

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Knowledge of how GIS works and why it's useful
2. **Technical Skills**: Proficiency in GIS software and analysis tools
3. **Problem-Solving Ability**: Capacity to design workflows for spatial questions
4. **Portfolio Projects**: Completed projects demonstrating your skills
5. **Career Readiness**: Skills employers value across many industries

## Assessment

Learning is reinforced through:

- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises for each major topic
- **Projects**: Larger assignments that integrate multiple skills
- **Self-Assessment**: Questions and challenges throughout
- **Final Project**: Your own GIS analysis from start to finish

## Getting Help

This is a self-guided course, but you're not alone:

- **Documentation**: Each topic includes extensive explanation and examples
- **Community**: Join GIS forums (Stack Exchange, Reddit r/gis)
- **Resources**: Links to tutorials, videos, and additional reading
- **GitHub**: Ask questions or report issues in the repository

## Course Philosophy

### Growth Mindset

Technical challenges are part of learning GIS. When you encounter problems:

- Don't get discouraged - this is normal!
- Error messages are learning opportunities
- Google and Stack Exchange are your friends
- Persistence and curiosity are more important than natural talent

### Open Source

This course is:

- **Free** to access and use
- **Open source** on GitHub
- **Community-driven** - contributions welcome!
- **Always improving** based on feedback
