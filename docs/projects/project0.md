# Project 0: Thinking Spatially

## Learning Goals

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. Familiarize yourself with geographic data and concepts
2. Begin to understand geographic data and how to access it
3. Think critically about maps and understand the basic components of a high-quality map

## Assignment Questions

### Question 1: Geographic Questions

List one question concerned with **geographic location, distribution, association, interaction, or change** about each of the following topics:

1. **Climate change**
2. **Urbanization**
3. **Biodiversity**
4. **Economic development**
5. **Geopolitics**

**Example questions**:
- What will the average temperature be in California in 2030? How will it vary by county?
- How have urban and built-up areas changed in SLO over the last 15 years?
- What is the geographic range of the Amazonian Jumping Frog?
- What is the income distribution among US counties?
- How many people were displaced by recent conflicts?

---

### Question 2: USGS Topographic Maps

1. Go to the [USGS website](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/)
2. Read about the history and use of USGS maps
3. Download the zipped topographic map that corresponds to your place of residence
   - Click the "Download Now" button and search for your hometown

**Submit**: A screenshot of the map you downloaded open on your computer.

### Question 3: Dynamic vs Static Maps

What features make a map **"dynamic"** or **"interactive"**? 

Are dynamic maps more informative than static maps? Why or why not?

---

### Question 4: Google Earth Exploration

Go to [Google Earth Online](https://earth.google.com/web/)

#### Part A: Explore Your Hometown

1. Examine an online map of the area where you grew up
2. Click the **"Add Data Layers"** button at the top of the map
3. Select some layers to add

**Questions**:
- List at least **1 more data layer** you'd be curious to visualize
- Click **"Show Historical Imagery"** and describe some changes that have occurred over time
- Which forms of **map generalization** were used to create the map?
  - Map generalization refers to the process of resolving conflicts associated with too much detail, too many features, or too much information to map
  - Which elements of generalization might you change?
  - Which elements are effective?
- **Include a screenshot** of the map in your submission

#### Part B: Compare Locations

Compare and contrast a map of where you grew up to a map of where you live now (presumably in SLO):

- Include screenshots of both maps
- Describe the differences and your reasoning behind them

### Question 5: Deforestation Project Planning

If you were to start a GIS project on **deforestation**, what factors would you need to consider? 

- What are the key metrics you might want to monitor?
- How would you define them?

---

## Submission Requirements

Submit to Canvas:

**One document** (Word or PDF) containing:

1. ✅ Answers to all questions (1-5)
2. ✅ Screenshot of USGS map downloaded and open
3. ✅ Screenshots from Google Earth exploration
4. ✅ Comparison maps (hometown vs current location)

---

## Grading

This is a foundational project to get you thinking spatially and exploring geographic concepts before diving into GIS software.

**Total Points**: Varies by instructor

---

## Tips for Success

- **Be thoughtful** in your geographic questions - think about patterns, distributions, and changes over space
- **Explore thoroughly** - Google Earth has many interesting layers and features
- **Compare meaningfully** - When comparing maps, think about what makes places similar or different geographically
- **Plan ahead** - Consider what data you'd actually need for a deforestation project
