## Written Questions [5 pts]

### Question 1: Map Scales

Determine and discuss the most appropriate **representative fractions** for the following verbal map scale descriptions:

1. Individual person
2. Neighborhood
3. Urban
4. Regional
5. National
6. Global

**Example**: A neighborhood map might use 1:10,000 while a global map might use 1:100,000,000

### Question 2: Map Projections

Go to the [National Atlas website](http://web.archive.org/web/20110717124751/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/mapping/a_projections.html) and read about map projections.

**Define the following terms**:

1. Datum
2. Developable surface
3. Secant
4. Azimuth
5. Rhumb line
6. Zenithal

---

### Question 3: Projection Properties

Describe the general properties of the following projections:

1. **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)**
2. **State Plane System**
3. **Robinson Projection**

---

### Question 4: Your USGS Map

Download a map for your place of residence from [USGS TopoView](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/)

**Report**:
- What is the **scale** of the map?
- What is the **projection**?
- What is the **contour interval**?

---

### Question 5: Coordinate Conversion

1. Find the **latitude and longitude** of your hometown
2. Explain how you can convert coordinates from **DD** (Decimal Degrees) to **DMS** (Degrees-Minutes-Seconds) or vice versa
3. Provide an **example calculation** for your hometown's coordinates

**Example**:
- DD: 35.2828° N
- DMS: 35° 16' 58" N

**Conversion formula**:
- Degrees = whole number
- Minutes = (decimal × 60) whole number  
- Seconds = (minutes decimal × 60)

## Tips for Success

### For Written Questions:
- **Be specific** with representative fractions
- **Use resources** - the National Atlas website is very helpful
- **Show your work** for coordinate conversions

### For Map Making:
- **Follow tutorials exactly** - don't skip steps
- **Take screenshots as you go** - easier than going back
- **Make sure maps look professional** - this is practice for real-world work
- **Check all elements** - missing a north arrow or scale bar = points lost

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Forgetting to include date/time in screenshots
- ❌ Submitting maps without all required elements
- ❌ Not following tutorial steps in order
- ❌ Screenshots too small to read
