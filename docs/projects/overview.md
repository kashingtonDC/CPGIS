## Project Philosophy

Each project builds on previous work:

0. **Project 0**: Develop spatial thinking foundations
1. **Project 1**: Learn the software and basic concepts
2. **Project 2**: Master vector analysis
3. **Project 3**: Add raster analysis skills
4. **Project 4**: Integrate multiple techniques (group)
5. **Final**: Apply everything independently
