- Analyze changes in satellite imagery (before/after)
- Calculate burn severity

**Urban Analysis**:
- Map coffee shop accessibility in your neighborhood
- Identify food deserts
- Analyze public transit coverage

**Environmental**:
- Model habitat suitability for a species
- Analyze vegetation health using NDVI
- Map stream water quality

**Social**:
- Analyze demographic patterns
- Map access to healthcare
- Study gentrification patterns

### Submission Requirements

**Submit**: 1 paragraph (150-250 words) including:
- Problem description
- Datasets to be used
- Processing techniques
- Expected results

---

## Phase 2: Final Project Check-Ins

### Purpose

The professor and TA will provide **directed feedback** based on your brainstorm submission.

**Meeting topics**:
- Set direction
- Select datasets
- Explore processing techniques

## Phase 3: Final Project Outline

### Assignment

Based on feedback from conversations and written comments, write a **one-page outline** describing your study.

### Format

**1. Introduction**

**What problem are you trying to solve?**

**Consider**:
- Why is it important?

## Project Scoping Guidelines

### Good Project Scope

✅ **Clear research question**
✅ **Defined geographic area** (neighborhood to county scale)
✅ **Limited time period** (1 year to 1 decade)
✅ **Available data** (free, accessible)
✅ **Achievable in 5 weeks** (with weekly progress)
✅ **Demonstrates GIS skills** (multiple tools used)

### Too Ambitious

❌ **Vague question** ("Study climate change")
❌ **Huge area** (entire continent)
❌ **Long time series** (100 years of data)
❌ **Data doesn't exist** (or is very expensive)
❌ **Too complex** (would take months)
❌ **Minimal GIS** (mostly manual work)

### Just Right Examples

✅ "How has urban development affected tree canopy cover in SLO (2010-2024)?"

✅ "Where are the best locations for new bike lanes in downtown based on current usage and destinations?"

✅ "What is the relationship between elevation and rainfall in the SLO watershed?"

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Waiting too long** to start
❌ **Scope creep** - adding more and more
❌ **Data issues** discovered late
❌ **Poor documentation** of methods
❌ **Low-quality maps** - missing elements
❌ **Weak discussion** - just restating results

❌ **Incomplete references**
❌ **Ignoring feedback** from check-ins
